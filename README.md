# Periodic-Table

The periodic table, also known as the periodic table of elements, is a tabular display of the chemical elements, which are arranged by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. The structure of the table shows periodic trends.

Here You can search the elements both by their periodic name and their atomic number. To search for the element by periodic name you have type “Element Name”- ”Atomic Number”. Also, as mentioned you can search the elements by their atomic number. After you search the element it will show you the results by displaying their details.

This Python script (ptable_trends.py) can be used to plot a heat map over an image of the periodic table of elements for easy and automated visualization of periodic trends.
